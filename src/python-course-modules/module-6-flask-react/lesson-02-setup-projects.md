# Lesson 02: Setting Up Flask and React Projects

## Setting Up Flask Backend
- Create a new folder for your Flask API
- Add `app.py` and install Flask

```bash
pip install flask
```

## Setting Up React Frontend
- Use `create-react-app` or Vite to scaffold a React project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

## Running Both Projects
- Start Flask API: `python app.py`
- Start React app: `npm start` or `npm run dev`

## Exercise
- Set up both projects and run them on different ports (e.g., Flask on 5000, React on 3000).
