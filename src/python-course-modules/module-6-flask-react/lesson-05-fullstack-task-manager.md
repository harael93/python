# Lesson 05: Building a Full-Stack App: Task Manager

## App Overview
Build a Task Manager app with a Flask backend and React frontend.

- **Backend**: Flask API with CRUD endpoints for tasks
- **Frontend**: React app that displays and manages tasks

## Steps
1. Set up Flask API with endpoints (`/tasks`, `/tasks/<id>`, etc.)
2. Set up React app with components for listing, adding, editing, and deleting tasks
3. Connect React to Flask using fetch/axios
4. Handle CORS and async requests

## Example Flow
- User adds a task in React
- React sends POST request to Flask
- Flask adds task and returns updated list
- React updates UI

## Exercise
- Implement both backend and frontend for the Task Manager app.
