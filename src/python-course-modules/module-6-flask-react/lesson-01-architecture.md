# Lesson 01: Full-Stack Architecture Overview

## What is Full-Stack Development?
Full-stack development involves building both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) of a web application.

- **Frontend**: User interface, built with React
- **Backend**: Data/API layer, built with Flask

## How Do They Communicate?
- The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API
- The backend processes requests and returns data (usually JSON)

## Example Flow
1. User interacts with React UI
2. React sends a request to Flask API
3. Flask processes and responds with data
4. React updates the UI

## Exercise
- Draw a diagram of a full-stack app showing how React and Flask communicate.
